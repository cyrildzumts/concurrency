Concurrenry  Library for C++

I'm working on a reactive library to ease the development of reactive systems.

This concurrency library will be a part the whole reactive library.
The aim of this concurrency lib is to provide basics components to run tasks concurrently.
In this library you will find : 
* a Thread safe queue
* a Threadpool
* an ActiveObject, see Patterns Oriented Software Architectur Vol. 2.
The goal is to implement a "smart" concurrency library where submitted task will be run synchronously or asynchronously depending on the current task queue configuration.
